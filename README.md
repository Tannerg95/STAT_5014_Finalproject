# STAT_5014_Finalproject
This repo is designed to hold the final project for stat 5014.  The collaborators for this project consists of Xueying Liu, Wie Liu, and Jonathan Glass

This project aims to study data from the pandemic and infer on its widespread effects across the world.  We have obtained data sets that are able to pull COVID case counts that update daily.  We aim to be able to build a script that is able to obtain this live day any time we choose to run it and perform different levels of inference on the data.  This data contains poistive case counts, location as well as respective populations of the countries for each day recording from the beginning of the year.


Our goal to perform inference on two different datasets.  We have a data set called timeseries that seperates case count by country per day.  Making a dataset that observes the data points as they recently develop as well as making inference and comparisons to countries throughout the year.  Including visuals and some statistcal inference to discuss which countries at certain times were points of interest.

The Hospital data set shows us how states in the United States are set up and located.  Our goal with this data set is to measure how well each state was prepeared for the pandemic throughout different times this year.
